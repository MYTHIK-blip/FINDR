# ðŸ§­ FINDR â€” Aotearoa Employment & Contract Intelligence Agent

## Ethos
FINDR exists to **connect anyone, regardless of circumstance, to viable work, tenders, training, or contract opportunities** in Aotearoa New Zealand.  
It is built with **dignity, transparency, and resilience** at its core â€” capable of serving those who are homeless, veterans, displaced professionals, students, young adults, or anyone seeking meaningful income and purpose.

Our guiding principle: *remove friction between a person and their next opportunity, while protecting privacy, safety, and agency.*

## Vision
A **national, barrier-aware opportunity finder** that:
- Aggregates **all public and partner-accessible work/tender/training sources**.
- Normalizes and enriches listings into **clear, machine- and human-readable formats**.
- Scores and ranks results for **fit, urgency, accessibility, and fairness**.
- Delivers actionable outputs â€” ready to upload to a CRM, save as CSV, integrate into downstream workflows, or provide as plain readable listings.

---

## Purpose
FINDR serves:
- Individuals in *any* employment situation or life stage.
- SMEs, NGOs, iwi, and community groups seeking to hire or subcontract locally.
- Career services, veteransâ€™ networks, and youth employment programs.
- Researchers, civic agencies, and AI-assisted workforce projects.
